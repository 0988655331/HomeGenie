# Widgets

## Introduction

Widgets are reusable and composite user interface components used to display data and information of a [module](programs.html#modules)
and that may also contain UI controls (such as buttons, sliders, ...) for interacting with them. 
Widgets use [MVC](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-View-Controller) design pattern, where the *View* is the HTML code
used for displaying the widget in the *UI*, the *Model* is small javascript code that access data of the bound module and
renders them to the view, and the *Controller* is the automation program that receives commands from the View (upon user
interaction) or other agents and implement the business logic of the module.

## Widget Editor

So, while the *Program Editor* can be used to implement the *Controller* part in the MVC, the Widget Editor is used to
implement the *View* and the *Model* part.
