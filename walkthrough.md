# Software Walkthrough

## Initial setup and configuration

After [HomeGenie installation](install.html), you can access it's **administration** site by entering  into your web browser the address (IP or hostname) of the computer where HG was installed:

{: .center}
![Administration page url]({{site.baseurl}}/images/docs/admin_page_url.png)

The start page is the *Dashboard* containing some **Widgets** such as *Weather*, *Alarm System*, *Energy Monitor*, *Thermostat*, a couple of sensors and lights.

This preset configuration is also a playable demo, useful for starting to learn some *HomeGenie* basics before you proceed to integrate your smart devices into it.

### Configuring Widgets

When you see a *gear button* in the upper right corner of a widget, it means that the widget have options that can be configured. Pressing the button will popup a configuration dialog.

### Weather Forecast Widget

HomeGenie can integrate also external services and make the data available to the system so that this can be used for automating task.

For example having motorized window shades to open or close on behalf of the sun position and the weather conditions (cloudy or not) or turning off the garden irrigation system if it's raining outside.

The Weather widget is based on [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com) and requires that the user create an account in order to obtain a *service key* that is needed to make the widget
functional (as shown in the picture above).
You will learn later how to use widgets data in a Wizard Script or Automation Program to automate tasks.
