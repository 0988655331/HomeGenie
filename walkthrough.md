# Software Walkthrough

## Initial setup and configuration

After [HomeGenie installation](install.html), you can access it's **administration** site by entering  into your web browser the address (IP or hostname) of the computer where HG was installed:

{: .center}
![Administration page url]({{site.baseurl}}/images/docs/admin_page_url.png)

The start page is the *Dashboard* containing some **Widgets** such as *Weather*, *Alarm System*, *Energy Monitor*, *Thermostat*, a couple of sensors and lights.
You can start learning some *HomeGenie* basics by playing with this factory configuration before you proceed integrating your smart devices into HG.
